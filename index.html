            A local budget cut and sweeping federal changes are projected to leave

            In the nation’s capital, the health and financial stability of more than
            272,000 people – one in every three residents – rests upon one of the most
            generous Medicaid programs in the country.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Now, the promise of care is under an unprecedented threat on two fronts. 
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Here is what will happen in the next decade, when that safety net begins to unravel, dot by dot, under the weight of political decisions made by local and federal officials.

                            The D.C. Medicaid program covered 272,249 residents by the end of June, according to the latest data from the Department of Health Care Finance. Each dot represents 500 enrollees.

                                The first blow comes from the D.C. government itself. In its July budget, the city cut eligibility for 25,000 residents – primarily working childless adults whose annual income is between $21,597 and $31,000 in 2025 – moving them from Medicaid to the more limited “Healthy DC” plan.

                            But for 3,000 residents with slightly higher incomes of up to $32,865 a year, there is no new plan. They lose their subsidized coverage entirely, pushed into the commercial market or, more likely, the ranks of the uninsured.

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What you must do:</strong> To keep your coverage, you will be required to perform and report at least <strong>80 hours per month</strong> of "community engagement," such as work, community service, job training or education.</li>
                            <li><strong>You must report your hours:</strong> You will have to report these hours to the D.C. government.</li>
                            ]<li><strong>Reporting is complex:</strong> The law requires you to prove you met the 80-hour rule for at least one month <em>before</em> you can enroll, and then verify it again at least every six months.</li>
                            <li><strong>No other insurance help:</strong> If you lose Medicaid for not meeting these requirements, the law also makes you <strong>ineligible for financial help</strong> (premium tax credits) to buy other health insurance on the ACA Marketplace.</li>

                <p>The KFF analysis reveals a “trickle-down” effect that threatens the entire local health infrastructure. The loss of 46,000 insured patients means hospital revenues will plummet.

                <p>The KFF analysis reveals a “trickle-down” effect that threatens the entire local health infrastructure. The loss of 46,000 insured patients means hospital revenues will plummet. 
                </p>

                <p>At the same time, the projected 32,000 new uninsured residents will create a surge in “uncompensated care costs that hospitals will face,” according to Euhus. 
                </p>

                <p>For a city with only “a handful of hospitals,” as Georgetown University professor Edwin Park noted, this pressure could be catastrophic, forcing providers to lay off staff or offer fewer services.
                </p>

                <p>“These cuts are the inevitable result of federal decisions… shifting costs to states and in turn forcing them to make really painful, harsh cuts,” Park said. 
                </p>

                <p>While data confirms that D.C. is among the hardest-hit jurisdictions in the nationwide Medicaid cuts, what the numbers cannot fully capture is the landscape of profound uncertainty that lies ahead.               
                </p>

                <p>“It definitely is an unprecedented number of cuts,” said Euhus. “I think everyone's kind of wondering how exactly it's going to play out. It's just not very clear.”
